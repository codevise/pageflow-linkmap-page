            # Hotspots

            Links with configurable click areas.

            Hotspots can play audio files, link to other pages in a Pageflow or to external websites. You can define as many hotspots as you want.

            Decide if you want to show a background image or a background video. (Keep in mind, that background videos will not be played on mobile devices, therefore use an additional fallback image for the mobile version)

            The hotspot page type allows to use panoramic images that are wider and taller than the screen-size. It enables users to explore these images by horizontal or vertical scrolling.

            To add a Hotspot just click on „Areas“ and choose between „Audio“, „Internal link“, or „External link“.

            There are two ways to display hotspot areas:

            ##  Hotspots as circles

            Display a white circle whose position and size can be defined by dragging. Click on the eye-symbol button of the corresponding hotspot and move this circle onto the desired position. If you use an audio file, a headphone-symbol will appear within the circle. The size of the symbol depends on the circle´s size. The circle becomes more visible when the cursor moves closer to it.

            ## Individually designed hotspots

            Alternatively, an additional panorama image can be used to determine the look of hotspots when the cursor hovers above them. Two images have to be prepared:

            1. An image with all hotspots in an inactive state (e.g. a map with cities represented by black dots)
            2. An image with all hotspots in an active state (e.g. the same map with red dots representing cities)

            Now the rectangular hotspot areas are positioned to cover the graphic representations of the hotspots. When the cursor hovers above one of the hotspots, the corresponding part of the hover-image will be displayed inside the hotspot's area. That way the hotspot is displayed in its active state while all others remain inactive.

            It is also possible to use videos instead of images. The following combinations are possible:

            1. Background image with hover image
            2. Background video with hover image
            3. Background image with hover video

            If you wish to mark hotspots as \"already visited\" you can also upload a „Visited-Image“ which then shows a certain spot in a different color after visiting the linked page.

            ## Free form hotspots

            It's not always possible to cover the visual elements of a
            panorama image with rectangular hotspots without creating
            overlapping hotspot areas. For example, trying to turn the
            countries on a map into clickable areas that change color
            when the cursor hovers a country is not possible with a
            single hover image: soon as a hotspot is not properly
            contained inside a county's borders, a part of the
            neighbor country changes its color together with the
            hovered country.

            For cases like this, we can use a so called mask image,
            allowing us to freely determine the shape of our
            hotspots. We need to create PNG image with transparent
            background on which the desired hotspot areas are
            represented as unicolor areas. The dimensions of the image
            have to match those of the panorama and hover images.

            For the map example, we could come up with an identically
            proportioned map image, in which each country's shape is
            filled with a different color leaving oceans and other
            non-clickable parts transparent.

            Once the map image has been selected, we can not only
            create new hotspots by dragging rectangular shapes, but
            also by clicking on of predefined colored areas given in
            the mask image.

            The shape of the hotspot corresponds exactly to the
            selected color area. Also when the hotspot is hovered the
            hover image is displayed cropped to that shape.

            When determining hotspot areas, only the area's color is
            taking into account: areas do not need to be connected.

            Hence, turning to the map example one last time, islands
            belonging to a country can also be highlighted together
            with the mainland when it is hovered, while the sea
            surrounding those islands need not be part of the
            clickable area.

            Important: Make sure that anti aliasing is turned off in
            your image composing application while preparing the mask
            image. We require a mask image with sharp edges and
            clearly separated areas. Anti aliasing on the other hand
            creates tiny color gradients which are then treated as
            multiple pixel sized areas. If an image contains too many
            different color values, trying to select it as a mask
            image leads to an error message inside the editor.

            At the moment, it is not possible to use mask images in
            combintation with hover images.

            ## Text options

            Both of these hotspot types can be entitled and have additional text/description.
            The description editor contains basic formatting options like bold, italic & underline.

            ## Atmo options

            Every Hotspot page, can play an additional backround sound that can optionally stop or continue playing (at the same or a lower volume) while an audio-Hotspot is playing.

            ## Further options

            Restrict scrolling to hotspot areas: Only scroll between hotspots.

            Force scrolling: Ensure there is a margin which ensures the panorama can be scrolled both vertically and horizontally.

            Deactivate scrolling at image border: Do not scroll in panorama view when user moves the cursor.

            Examples of application: Menu site, multiple choice, exploration tour
